"""Export Francine's assistant interaction log for evals and skills.

Usage (from glucose-app/):
  tools/pull-db.sh [serial]                    # either phone: records sync both ways
  python3 tools/export-assistant-log.py [--db data/glucose.db] [--out data/assistant-log.jsonl] [--include-debug]

Writes one interaction per line (JSONL): what she said or typed, where
(watch / watch-queued / phone / debug), which parser handled it and what was
tried first, model usage and cost, the model trace (full on the phone where
it happened; trimmed on the other), what was proposed, and the OUTCOME — the
eval label — with later corrections resolved against the journal: each saved
row is "kept", "edited" (and to what), "confirmed" (a guess she kept),
"deleted" or "missing" (not synced yet).

Prints a short summary. Records from ADB test ops (source "debug") are in
the file but left out of the summary unless --include-debug.

The output is health data: it stays in data/ (gitignored). Apple's
/usr/bin/python3 (3.9) is enough; stdlib only.
