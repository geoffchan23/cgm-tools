val LOGGING_RULES = """
- kind is "dose" for insulin, "event" for food, drink or exercise.
- type is exactly "short-acting" or "long-acting". "19+4" means two doses. If the person says which is which, follow that. Otherwise the 19 or 20 is long-acting and the other is short-acting. A dose without a type is short-acting.
- units is a whole number.
- time is 24-hour "HH:mm". Use a time the person states ("at 7pm" is "19:00"). Otherwise: breakfast or morning coffee "10:30", lunch "13:00", afternoon snack "15:00", dinner "17:30", dessert or evening snack "21:30", bedtime "23:00". A dose taken with a meal gets that meal's time. If you cannot tell the time, use null.
- A stated time belongs only to the item it is attached to. A meal word wins for its own items: in "dinner was a chicken burger with 6, and a cookie around 7", the chicken burger and the 6 units are "17:30" and only the cookie is "19:00".
- name is lowercase, in the person's own words, and KEEPS every amount and size they said: "15 g cheddar cheese", "half a medium pizza hut pizza", "2 slices sourdough", "30 min walk". Never drop a number from a food.
- Foods eaten together at the same time are ONE event with all of them in its name, joined the way the person said them: "sourdough bread with butter and jam and 15 g cheddar cheese" is one event, not four. Only coffee, candy and exercise are always their own events. Keep "coffee" and "chicken burger" exactly as written.
- Do not log food the person says they did not eat. Do not invent anything.
